										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Just got back from a 4 day/4 night trip from Singapore and I am officially in love with this small country in Southeast Asia. The first thing you notice in Singapore is just how clean and beautiful the country is. Next, you are blown away by the great diversity of the population and the tourists that are visiting the country. Driving through downtown on the way into the city, you cannot help but marvel at the majestic Marina Bay Sands, the Cloud Forest, the Singapore Flyer, and the SuperTree Grove. Pictures from Crazy Rich Asians flash in your head as you take in the immense wealth and potential the country holds. Immediately after visiting the country, I had to look up some history on how it has managed to prosper so well and I was shocked to find out that Singapore has only existed as an independent country for just over 50 years, only gaining independence in 1965! What’s even crazier is that the country has evolved from being a third world country when it was founded to a first world country in the matter of one generation, an astounding feat in itself. The country has also only had 3 prime ministers in it’s 54 years of independence and holds a one party meritocracy in it’s governing body.</p>
<p class="p1">My trip to Singapore was taken as a solo vacation &#8211; a solocation for short so I was hyper eager to soak in all the culture had to offer. Having grown up in India and visited a few countries in Southeast Asia, I have grown to expect a few surefire signs of being in Asia. In my mind upon arriving in Singapore, I expected there to be a homeless population easily visible even to tourists. Further, I expected there to be zero laws for drivers, and the make your own lane rule to govern how traffic flows. Finally, a subtle but noticeable fog/haziness was expected in the air from the pollution based on my previous experiences in Asia. Needless to say, none of this existed in Singapore. The homeless population is completely non-existent. Traffic flows without any honking and is managed beautifully. And the air, although very humid with up to 90% humidity, is very crisp and clean. Having stumped my beliefs of this actually being an Asian country, Singapore went above and beyond in blowing me away by just how safe it felt &#8211; even though I could not have looked any more like a tourist &#8211; by wearing a shirt with the Texas flag on it, an Astros ball cap and being glued to my phone for directions wherever I went, no part of Singapore felt unsafe. What was even cooler was how easy it was to use public transport in the city. On trip advisor, the number one rated attraction in Singapore is the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT). Number one attraction in a city that holds the super tree grove, cloud forest, Marina Bay sands had me somewhat bewildered but after riding the train everywhere in the city for just 1-2 Singapore dollars per ride, I can see why it’s the best rated tourist attraction in the whole country.</p>
<p class="p1">My Singapore Solocation was split into two parts &#8211; part one was taking in the glitz and glamour of the country. This part consisted of trying delicious noms at the renowned Birds of a Feather restaurant. Next, I couldn’t leave the country without trying out some of the absolutely incredible cocktail bars. Operation Dagger was the first watering hole I visited where the bartenders made the most unique variation of an old fashioned that I have ever tried &#8211; this drink contained bee pollen and a dark chocolate twig. The bartenders could not have been nicer here and they hooked me up with a list of restaurants and other cocktail bars in the city to check out. Next on the treat yo self tour was checking out bar Manhattan in the Regent hotel. This bar is rated the best bar in Asia and the 3rd best bar in the world as of 2019 and boy did it ever hold up to that billing. The New York Sour was decadent and delicious, the waitstaff exemplary, and the ambiance and setting of the bar second to none. Having spent all of my next month’s pay check schmoozing, the 2nd part of my solocation involved checking out the more locals side of the country &#8211; and this part was even more delicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>New York Sour at the 3rd best bar in the world:</strong></span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96" src="https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unadjustednonraw_thumb_15c5.jpg" alt="UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_15c5.jpg" width="665" height="1182" /></p>
<p class="p1">While you can spend your whole vacation in Singapore visiting the top rated sites on Trip Advisor, you will be doing yourself a huge dis-service if you leave here without trying out the dozens of food hawker centers littered around the country. These hawker centers will get you a plate of authentic local food for under 5 Singapore Dollars. Plus, all varieties of food from Singaporean Laksa, to Malay dishes, to authentic Chinese food, to Indian delicacies to the most pungent but tasty desserts in South Asia made with Dorian can be bought for just a few dollars each. This was by far my favourite part of Singapore as the spices, flavours, ad aromas of these hawker centers were second to none &#8211; and my belly could not have been happier from the experience. There are some more touristy hawker centers like Newton food center that was depicted in Crazy Rich Asians and some more local friendly and tasty centers like the Maxwell food center but my list of the must try Hawker centers Food Recommendations are listed here:</p>

<p class="p1">That about covers my overview of an unforgettable solocation to Singapore. For those of you interested, here’s a quick list of tourist attractions I believe are worth visiting, in order of their value for your time:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">Sentosa Island via cablecar</li>
<li class="li1">Singapore Zoo</li>
<li class="li1">Cloud Forest/Flower Garden &#8211; air conditioned</li>
<li class="li1">SuperTree Grove &#8211; daily shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm</li>
<li class="li1">Marina Bay Sands</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, long distance relationships, how I loathe thee. If you have come upon this page, I can only imagine you are in the middle of a long distance relationship or about to embark on a long distance relationship adventure. Well, fear not &#8211; having survived (albeit with some bumps and bruises) a long distance relationship with a 17 hour time difference and 8998 miles of separation, I have an arsenal of tips to help you out.</p>
<p>First and foremost, before embarking on a long distance relationship &#8211; make sure you are truly committed to the person &#8211; SERIOUSLY &#8211; really make sure you are willing to put up with a lot of nights and days of feeling extremely lonely and frustrated. It is wise to have a conversation about this with your partner and make sure they are on the same page because it takes two wholly committed parties to make this wild adventure work.</p>
<p>Now, there are definitely things you can do to make it suck less, although mind you &#8211; it will SUCK &#8211; A LOT &#8211; LIKE A WHOLE LOT &#8211; at times. Here are a quick 5 tips to help you make it out alive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get connected on as many apps as possible. Me and my girlfriend had a total of 11 different mediums we were communicating on during our long distance adventure. When the person you want to see most in the world can&#8217;t be physically there with you, it is a really great feeling to get constant updates from them via a plethora of apps and communication platforms. In my personal experience, listening to a song from a Spotify shared playlist that your partner added is the biggest mood booster and can help get you out of a crummy mood quickly.
<ul>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Facebook Messenger</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>Spotify Shared Playlist</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>Facetime</li>
<li>Texting</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Shared Photo Libraries on Icloud</li>
<li>Fitbit Challenges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read Books Together!!! &#8211; This should really be tip number 1 but I would recommend taking some time with your partner to talk about common interests and decide a book you are both interested in reading and start your own two person book club. This has a whole lot of benefits for your relationship, starting with a great discussion topic whenever you chat, to imagining your partner reading the book whenever you are reading, to helping you grow mentally rather than numbing your mind away until you see your SigO next. I have read other Long Distance preparation blogs that recommend watching Netflix shows or movies together but I found books were way more valuable for enriching your mind beyond just the few hours of the Netflix binge and the ideas help keep your mind distracted from the long distance annoyance for longer.</li>
<li>Always have your next meet-up planned as early as possible. One of the best and only ways to deal with the mental insanity of long distance is to know that you will have to only deal with it for 32 more days, then 31 more days, then 30 more days. Make sure to have a concrete date set for your meet-ups at all times AND before you leave a meet-up, make sure to plan the next one so you are not completely destroyed on your flight back. Bonus tip: Downloading countdown apps on your phone really helps and a countdown timer to look at every morning is a great reminder that you are getting closer to seeing your boo.</li>
<li>&#8220;Exercise is the most underutilized anti-depressant&#8221; This holds extremely true during long distance. During especially tough times, the endorphin rush from a good workout was the main saving grace to get through another night. My girlfriend and I even participated in a couple of <a href="https://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/30-day-push-up-challenge">30 day pushup</a> or <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/79938962112500339/">30 day plank </a> challenges &#8211; which aside from being really good for you can help you feel connected with your partner knowing they are doing the same in another city as well. Even a nice walk or jog outside at times is the perfect way to get out of your funk, trust me &#8211; just try it!</li>
<li>Adapt. React. Readapt. Apt. For the non Micheal Scott fans out there, the final tip is to adapt and improve your relationship over time. One of the main things that my lady friend and I did was at the end of every meet-up, we would ask each other what was working well for the other person and what could be improved upon. For example, after feeling disconnected on the day-to-day happenings in each others lives, we decided that an improvement we could make is to send each other snapchats more often &#8211; even if they were of nonsensical happenings throughout the day. Having this conversation on the way to the airport whenever you are super mellow and emotional is also a good idea as it can help you snap out of the emotional anguish and get your rational brain back online to lay out a game plan to improve your relationship.</li>
<li>Bonus Tip: Memes. This post is titled a millennial guide after all. Me and my partner in crime LOVED sharing memes with each other during our LDR. From pictures of goats, to doggos, to Cardi B memes, we had a meme for everything to help brighten each other&#8217;s days. There was even a meme created about the immaturity of handling long distance with memes: <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-87" src="https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_1219.jpg" alt="IMG_1219" width="696" height="391" srcset="https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_1219.jpg 696w, https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_1219-300x169.jpg 300w, https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_1219-600x337.jpg 600w, https://github.com/andypande/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_1219-590x330.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you brave long distance adventurers out there. Remember, it will all be worth it and you feel like like you have conquered a Herculean task when you are back in the same time zone.</p>
