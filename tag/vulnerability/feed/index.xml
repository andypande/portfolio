										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year, I was lucky enough to be introduced to the work of Brene Brown and vulnerability. Brene Brown is commonly known as the world&#8217;s foremost vulnerability researcher who covers vulnerability from a research perspective and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. She has one of the top 5 all-time most viewed <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=hy">TED Talks</a> about vulnerability which has garnered over 35 million views. Personally, as an engineer and downright textbook left-brained individual, the mushy feeling of vulnerability has always felt incredibly overwhelming. That is, until I came across the work of Brene Brown. Dr. Brown takes an analytical look at vulnerability in her book Daring Greatly, digging into vulnerability with the idea that there are a few repeatable steps you can follow to implement vulnerability in your life, just like a new diet or workout routine. She brilliantly documents her personal struggle with vulnerability when she discovers it is not something that can be incorporated into your life with a formula. Reading her struggles feel eerily similar to the struggles my analytical mind has felt with vulnerability and seeing her mission to accept vulnerability and shame as part of her daily life is an inspiring story to help integrate even the most stoic individual. Having read her book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419?sa-no-redirect=1">Daring Greatly</a> has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever been lucky enough to experience. I would truly recommend everyone take the time to read this masterpiece once, and then once more to really let it sink in. But, before digging into it &#8211; here&#8217;s a quick overview of what&#8217;s covered in her TED Talk and the book:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Connection is why we are here – it’s what gives purpose and meaning to all our lives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">SHAME is understood as the fear of disconnection</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Is there something about me, that if other people know it or see it, that I won’t be worthy of connection?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">No one wants to talk about SHAME – and the less you talk about it, the more you have it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Shame is basically the “I’m not ______ enough” feeling</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, REALLY SEEN(warts and all)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">People who really have a sense of worthiness – a strong sense of love and belonging – and folks who struggle for it ARE ONLY SEPARATED BY ONE VARIABLE </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">People with a strong sense of love and belong BELIEVE they are WORTHY of a sense of love and belonging…THAT’S IT!!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The one thing that keeps most people out of connection is the feeling that we are not worthy of connection</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">There are 4 traits of people who live a wholehearted life</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Courage – tell the story of who you are with a whole heart. Have the courage to be imperfect</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Compassion – be kind to YOURSELF first and then to others</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Self-kindness – be warm and understanding towards ourselves when we fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Common humanity – recognize that suffering and feelings of personal inadequacy are part of the shared human experience – we all go through it!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Mindfulness – take a balanced approach to negative emotions – do not “over identify” with thoughts and feelings so that we are not swept up by negativity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Talk to yourself the same way you would talk to someone you care about – simple as that! Appreciate the beauty of our cracks and imperfections</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Connection – willing to let go of who they thought they should be, in order to be who they were to build strong connection </span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Good strategy is to carry around a piece of paper in wallet that has names of people whose opinions really matter to you – who love you for your strength and struggles. Aside from these people, you should not care about what any other random humans think of you who have a fleeting impact in your life. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Vulnerability – FULLY embraced vulnerability. They believe that what makes them vulnerable makes them beautiful. The willingness to take the leap of faith and dare greatly.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Humans are very adept at numbing emotions and vulnerability</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">This generation is the most in-debt, obese, addicted to drugs and alcohol and medicated cohort in adult history</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Problem is – you cannot SELECTIVELY numb emotion. You cannot numb shame, fear, vulnerability selectively. Numbing the bad emotions numbs joy, gratitude, happiness and good feelings as well. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Need to be very cautious about how and why we numb – numb by making the uncertain certain, numb by blaming others, numb by perfection, numb by pretending what we are doing doesn’t have an impact on other people</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Listen with great care if people love say they are concerned about you engaging in certain type of behaviors</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Main takeaways to practice</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Let ourselves be seen – really seen </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Love with our whole heart</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Practice gratitude and joy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Believe ‘I am enough’ – allows us to be kinder and gentler to ourselves and others around</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Shame-resliency in the workplace. 4 best strategies for building shame resilient organizations are:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Supporting leaders who are willing to dare greatly and facilitate honest conversations about shame</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Deeply looking into where shame might be functioning in the org </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Not normalizing shame. Leaders can cultivate engagement by letting people know what to expect – what common struggles are and how other people have dealt with them</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Training all employees on difference between shame and guilt and how to give and receive feedback in a way that fosters growth and engagement.</span></li>
</ol>
